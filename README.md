# CreateAllianceRestored
Adds interactions to create an an alliance between you and any character and to break any alliance between you and any character.

Known Issues:
Breaking an alliance forged through a marriage then trying to re-negociate it seems to be broken. You can just re-create the alliance using this mod--if someone knows a real fix, let me know.

Verified working on 1.9.2.1.
